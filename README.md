# 🎮 Multi Panel – A Manifesto

Arcade was never just about games.

It was about control.

Not buttons.
Not joysticks.
But *interfaces designed around a single experience*.

Street Fighter 1 had pressure.
Lunar Lander had thrust.
Tempest had a spinner.
Tron had rotation.
Ikari Warriors had dual rotary.
Pop’n Music had impact and rhythm.

Each game had its own panel.
Its own logic.
Its own physical language.

Modern setups flatten everything
into one generic controller.

Multi Panel rejects that idea.

We believe each game deserves
its own control philosophy.

Not replication for nostalgia.
Reconstruction for sensation.

Using today’s tools:
microcontrollers,
sensors,
rotary encoders,
USB,
modular design.

We rebuild what mattered:
resistance,
inertia,
pressure curves,
rotation,
weight,
feedback.

No compressors.
No rare hardware.
No fragile legacy systems.

Just intelligent reinterpretation.

Multi Panel is not about copying the past.

It is about restoring the physical identity of arcade games
with modern materials.

Because arcade was never just pixels on a screen.

It was something you felt.
